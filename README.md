This repository has been archived due to rethinking, refactoring, etc.

The updated project is located in a new repository and is called [OneMessageBot](https://github.com/ZooMMaX/OneMessageBot).

## Attention!
### Due to the large number of fixes, OneMessageBot is not backward compatible with TelegramBotApp!!!
